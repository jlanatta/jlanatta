## Hi there, I'm Javier 👋
I've been a developer for more than 20 years. During all these years I've been pretty busy:
- I started my professional career in 1998 writing embedded apps in C running in the wonderful QNX realtime operating system.
- Of course, after that came the web so I wrote some websites using ASP. Later on, I moved to Java/JSP.
- In 2004 some super enlightened people and me founded Quadion Technologies. Our goal was to provide awesome-level developing services and we've been rocking since then.
- Around 2007 I wrote my first Ruby on Rails webapp and there is no way you can convince me that there is anything faster to prototype and end up with real world app, no f\*\*\*ing way.
- I'm also kind of a Mac fanatic and the minute Apple released the first iPhone SDK I was already playing with it. I wrote my first app in 2010 and it was a success. Certainly, at that time the app store was a way different zoo. And yes, since then I've been doing both RoR and native iOS because they are my passion.

### Some non-work related facts about me
- I love cocktails 🍸, love them so much that I studied a lot and I even set up a bar at home.
- I studied Culinary Arts and became a professional cook 🧑‍🍳. I love good food and what better way to enjoy it than knowing how to prepare it and also making it 🤣.
- 🏹 I shoot barebow archery 🎯.
